# R-course-3-project

This is the course project for Getting and Cleaning data in R the R script "run_analysis.R" will:
download the data from the web, load the activity and feature data, loads both the training and test datasets keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation, loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset.
merges two sets and converts activity and subject columns into factors.
finally, creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

the results are in the file "FinishedData.txt"
